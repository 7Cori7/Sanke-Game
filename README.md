# Snake game 🎮

This is a simple javascript exercise I made. It recreates the retro video game called "Snake".

You can play it on your computer or on your phone.

The objective is for the snake to eat the "food" that will render on the board, the more food you eat, the
more points you'll earn. If the snake collide with the walls or with itself, is game-over!

You can choose between 3 difficulties and your highest score would be saved in the localStorage.

The difficulty will increase the speed of the snake, but also, will increase the bonuses you'll get for eating the
"special food".


INSTRUCTIONS TO PLAY:

PC:
- In the home screen, press the spacebar on your keyboard.
- In the game options screen, you can choose the difficulty by pressing either 1, 2 or 3 in your keyboard.
- Move the snake using the arrow keys in your keyboard.

Phone:
- In the home screen, tap on the "spacebar" button you'll see.
- In the game options screen, you can tap on either the button "1", "2" or "3" to choose the difficulty.
- Move the snake tapping on the controll buttons you'll see on screen.
