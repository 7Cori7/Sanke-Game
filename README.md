This is a simple javascript exercise I made. It recreates the retro video game called "Snake".

You can play it on your computer or on your phone (although I would recommend to play it on computer since phone controllers aren't optimized yet).

You can choose between 3 difficulties and your highest score would be saved in the localStorage.
The game is hosted on Netlify.

Have fun! 🐍💕
